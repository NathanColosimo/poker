## Key Features Implemented

### 🎮 Game Flow

### 🃏 Texas Hold'em Rules
- **Betting Rounds**: Pre-flop, Flop, Turn, River

- **Validation**: Enforces proper bet amounts and increments
- **Auto-advancement**: Automatically moves to next round when all players have acted

- **Dealer Button**: Auto-rotates clockwise each hand

### 📱 Mobile Optimization

- Gradient backgrounds for visual appeal

### 🔐 Authentication

## How to Run

```bash
# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

This will:
1. Start Vite frontend on `http://localhost:5173`
2. Start Convex backend (will prompt for setup on first run)
3. Open browser automatically

## Game Settings

All customizable when creating a game:
- **Initial Chips**: Starting chip stack (default: 1000)
- **Small Blind**: Small blind amount (default: 10)
- **Big Blind**: Big blind amount (default: 20)
- **Betting Increment**: Minimum raise amount (default: 10)

## Game Rules & Limitations

### Current Implementation
✅ Full betting rounds with proper validation
✅ Auto-rotating dealer and blinds
✅ Fold, Check, Call, Raise, All-In support
✅ Players eliminated when out of chips
✅ Real-time synchronization across all devices
✅ Mobile-first responsive design

### Not Yet Implemented (Future Features)
- ⏳ Mid-game player joins (locked after game starts)
- ⏳ Player buy-back in after elimination
- ⏳ Pot splitting for side pots (all-ins)
- ⏳ Hand winner determination (manual for now)
- ⏳ Game history and statistics
- ⏳ Chat/communication between players

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Hash-Based Routing?
- No external dependencies needed
- Simple and effective for single-page app
- Works perfectly with Convex real-time updates
- Easy to understand and maintain

### Why Bottom-Sheet Betting Interface?
- Mobile-first design principle
- Keeps chips and bet amounts visible
- Easy thumb reach on mobile devices
- Familiar pattern from mobile apps

### Why Separate Player and Hand States?
- Cleaner data model
- Easy to track hand-specific vs game-specific state
- Efficient queries (only fetch current hand data)
- Supports future features like hand history

## Testing the App

### Test Scenario 1: Basic Game
1. Sign up as User 1
2. Create game with code "POKER123"
3. Sign up as User 2 (different browser/device)
4. Join game with code "POKER123"
5. Back to User 1: Approve User 2
6. Arrange seating
7. Start game
8. Play through a complete hand

### Test Scenario 2: Betting Actions
1. Create game with 3+ players
2. Test each action:
   - Fold
   - Check (when possible)
   - Call
   - Raise (minimum increment)
   - All-In
3. Verify betting rounds advance correctly
4. Complete hand and start new one

### Test Scenario 3: Edge Cases
1. Try joining with invalid code → Error
2. Try joining after game started → Error
3. Try betting out of turn → Disabled
4. Try invalid raise amount → Error
5. Verify blinds post correctly
6. Verify dealer rotates correctly
